The way we perceive art is unique to each individual and is influenced by our experiences, emotions, and cultural backgrounds.Art can evoke a range of emotions, from joy and admiration to sadness and contemplation. The interpretation of art is subjective, and what one person sees or feels may be different from another's experience.Perception also plays a role in the creation of art. Artists use their own perceptions and experiences to create works that express their unique perspectives. Through their art, they can convey their perceptions of the world around them, whether it's a landscape, a portrait, or an abstract piece.",
